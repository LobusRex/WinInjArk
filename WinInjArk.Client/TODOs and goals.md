# TODOs and goals

## Visualization and logging
* Use Scrutor to decorate IServiceScopeFactory with our own scope factory that adds an ID to the socpes.
* Make a form with a tree view to show scopes and their forms.

## Components
I don't know what to do with UserControls.
If we DI them, can we still get them to show in the designer?
Or should I be up to the owning form to handle composition?
